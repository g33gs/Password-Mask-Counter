# Password-Mask-Counter

Takes a list of passwords, and determines the password mask for each one. It then will determine the top 3 most common masks used within the list, and output them neatly, like so:

```
Top 3 Password Masks
--------------------       
1. ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d : 17766
2. ?d?d?d?d?d?d : 14832    
3. ?l?l?l?l?l?l : 13329 
```

#### Make sure to change the file path to the correct list location.
